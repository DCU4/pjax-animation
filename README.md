# pjax animation
## WIP

This is barely alpha. Please use at your own risk.

Using pushState() and css animations, build out smooth, custom animations between pages. No white blink, blazing fast load times, and full SEO changes. 

Just add the `data-pjax-wrapper` data attribute to the body, and the `data-pjax-main` to the element wrapping the element(s) you would like to animate, and then call the `pjaxAnimate()` function in your js.
